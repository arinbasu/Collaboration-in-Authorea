The purpose of this article is to test whether it is possible to write entirely in markdown in Authorea, and then download everything, or add stuff written in markdown and then work or export in any format we llike. 
Of course in markdown you do not get tables, so peharps open a table in another chunk. 

1. Invite colleagues
2. Set up writing in markdown 
3. If they mess up bibliography fix yourself
4. Export in RTF -> Google Docs -> Word
5. Else PDF
