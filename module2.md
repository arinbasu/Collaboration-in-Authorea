## R for Scientific and Statistical Procedures 

## Module 1: Obtaining, Installing and Help Seeking

## Introduction, What Shall We Learn?
* What is R?
* Obtain and Install R
* Obtain Help inside and outside of R
* For best results, follow along our examples in R

## What is R?

* Statistical Programming Environment
* More than Just a Statistical Software
* You can do Data Analysis
* You can write reports
* You can develop new procedures

## R is Open Source and Free

* You Can Obtain R free of Cost
* You can also freely distribute R
* You can access the source code of R
* You can modify codes of R
* You can extend R as you wish

## How can you Obtain R?

* From CRAN
* Visit: http://cran.r-project.org
* Different Flavours of R
* Select the Binary Files According to your Operating System
* You can obtain additional packages in two ways:
* From Inside R
* From other Repositories

## Flavours of R
* Base R
* R can be compiled from Source code (Advanced)
* You can also install development packages from CRAN site (Advanced)
* For Beginners, best to use Stable Versions of R
* Make sure you have the right to install packages on the computer you use
* Select the appropriate binary, download, and double click to install

## After Installation, appearance of R



## Use R with other editors

* Try using R with RStudio for easy work
* Download RStudio from http://www.rstudio.com
* For a List of Other Editors, see http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/projects/Editors.html
* Use RCommander if you like GUI, see http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/
* In this tutorial, we shall use RStudio

## Download and Install RStudio (Recommended)
* First Download and Install R
* Then Install RStudio

## Appearance of RStudio


## First, Set Your Directory
* Always set a directory where you will be working
* Keep your data and codes in that directory
* To set a directory, in R console, write the following code:
* setwd(“The file path where your code and data will be stored”)
* You can retrieve your working directory by typing getwd()

## Second, Learn how to obtain help within R
* Type help.start() in console - read the manual
* If you know what to ask for, type ‘help(“topic”)’
* Example, for linear modelling, type, help(“lm”)
* If you do not know what to ask for, type ‘??”topic name”’
* Example: for linear regression, type, ??”linear regression”

## Screenshot of “??”linear regression”


## Third, how to obtain help outside of R
* Read the R FAQ, http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html
* Read the R manuals, http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
* Read several other guides from here, http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html
* Subscribe to R Help forum, see https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help

## Where to obtain help when time pressed

1. Start with Using ?? Or help()
2. If that does not help, search Google
3. If 1 and 2 do not work, ask the question in the forum
4. Follow up reading from the guides 

## Conclusion: What did we learn in First Module?
* We learned what is R
* How to obtain and install R
* Learned about using RStudio to do your work
* How to set working directory
* Learned how to obtain help in R in many ways

## Next, We Shall Learn
* How to Read Data Into R
* How to Export Data from R to Other Programmes
* How to Write Your Own Functions in R
* What is meant by Objects in R
